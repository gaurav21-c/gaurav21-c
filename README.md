### 🧑‍💻 Code Samples

Here is an example of clean, maintainable code:

```php
// Recursive function to calculate factorial
function factorial($number) {
    if ($number <= 1) {
        return 1;
    }
    return $number * factorial($number - 1);
}

// Testing the factorial function
echo factorial(5); // Output: 120
